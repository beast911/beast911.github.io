Dear Shuang,

I have been thinking of our discussions about our travels so far. We talked about it for lengths; our reasons, our escapes, our approach towards everything within and beyond our control. That led to me thinking about the question "Why do we travel".
I tried in my usual way, generalize the question which became to "Why does everyone travel". It has made my head swirl because there could be millions of reasons irrelevant to our discussion; and that made me think about the question again. "Why do WE travel". I took everything from the question except the "WE" part. Now I am thinking about one particular discussion we had in Monterosso; our escape, our adaptability, our bravery, venturing into the realm of unknown places, languages, settings.

The fog that had clouded my vision about this question was starting to dissipate and I was able to see further ahead. We have one thing common with other travelers; it is the time which we live in; moving from one place to another on the whim of a thought checking up on the internet nearby attractions, making itineraries, going to those particular spots or attractions and voila, you have a textbook travel; add a hostel booking and you have your textbook backpacker travel now-a-days. But, the difference here between us and "them" is the uncertainty of the adventure, the ability to accept that uncertainty and let it shape us; or rather a part of us; we have various segments in our personalities, some rigid, some flexible and we have the capability to separate them and realize what defines our core values. This ability to segregate makes us different.

Another thing that makes us different is the escape; some people escape the place but we escape the people, because we want to know what is out there and our thirst for knowledge about everything keeps pushing us into those unknown realms where we try to learn from everything; from the tiniest bird to the biggest human, we learn from everything, we want to learn from everything, know about lot of things, explore about everything.

I have made couple of conclusions from this; in earlier times, when most of the earth was unexplored, certain brave group of personnel would venture into the unknown to record the places that we know today. Columbus or Alexander or Genghis Khan wouldn't be what they are today if it weren't for these people, these were called the explorers; the numero uno, the original travelers. These people defined what the land, sea and sky is today. These brave-hearts who dared to venture into the unknown, were the ones that spawned this travel generation.

But we strive to go beyond that; we let travel mold us like those explorers let the unknowns mold them, we wish to know everything around us like those explorers, we venture into the unknown like those explorers, we escape like those explorers because they knew there would be more beyond where they currently were, we are brave like those explorers. We desire to be explorers, we are the explorers. In these times of infinite information at your disposal in fraction of a second, we try to gain real knowledge about our life. This ability of ours, being an explorer, transcends into our lives and not just travel; we strive for the best and try to find new paths which will satisfy that burning sensation in our heart that keeps us moving forward.

All I want to say, is that let us embrace this inner explorer in us and use it formidably in our lives so that we become the numero uno, the bravest, the strongest of the mind in this journey called life.

The owl is not blind in the day, rather it sees things more clear than others. They fly high above the forests and see everything under them.

We, the explorers.
