Around 8 pm, he comes along with his daughter, i think, and his little trolley just a few metres away from our house gate on the roadside. In winters, he brings groundnuts, gateaux and other things like rewaris. In summers, he brings fruit ice-cream and leaves his spot in the night between ten and eleven. He is Pyare Mohan.
Our Chehhartta is a small town on the outskirts of Amritsar. Pyare Mohan lives in Bhalla Colony. I had not knew earlier but during my art and craft workshops, I saw him in the colony. He lives with his two brothers. Pyare is the eldest among them. They have some business. The only difference is that the youngest brother does not station his trolley in the winters. Only Pyare brings his stall of groundnuts. But still i felt his business is not working well. Never mind but he still went on.
“Bring some peanuts.”, said my mother entering the room. I was studying at that time. “Please bring them from Prem’s, he has better quality”, said my brother. I was desperate. I took the ten bucks from my mother’s left drawer from her esk.
I forgot my spectacles which were lying on the computer desk; still i went out. I was thinking something on my way which i can’t remember now. While I was walking down towards the stall, I came across the stall of Pyare Mohan. he is a tall man, thin, with black hair and grey beard like unshaved for two weeks. I said, “Give me some peanuts for ten bucks.”. He nodded and put his hand in them and took out some in the poly bag and weighed them. I said, “Add some sweets too.”. He gave no expression and took the poly bag and took out some peanuts and replaced them with some sweets and candy; weighed them again and gave it back to me.
I walked slowly towards home. On reaching back, my brother took the bag from me and asked, “How did you came back so early. You must have brought from that Pyare Mohan.”. “No, I ran all the way.”, i retorted. “Oh come on, I remember this packing.”, he said.
“How can you say this is from Pyare or Prem’s , and by the way, let me complete my lessons.”, I said. And moved back to my place in the quilt and went on with my lessons.
On that day my father came home late. “Are there some peanuts left ?”, he asked after changing his clothes. “There might be some left. Mom took the packet and kept in her left drawer of her desk.”, I replied. he finished the dinner and I brought the pack of peanuts. “They might be from Pyare Mohan. Did you bought this from him ?” he asked. “Yes”, I replied.
He lowered his shoulders and said nothing. I moved to my room and went to bed thinking about Pyare. “See, even dad also said that his quality is not good”, my brother said. “But he didn’t said anything”, i replied. “That means he is not happy with it.” he said.

I said nothing and quickly went to bed.
